"""
    Object Oriented Programming
    1. Class is a blueprint to create instances and each unique employee that we create
    using our employee class will be an instance of that class.
    2. Instance variable contain data that is unique to each instance.
    3. Class variables are variables that are shared shared among all instances of a class.
    4. regular method automatically take the instance as the first argument by calling self
    5. class method is same as regular method with addition by adding a decorator to the top called @classmethod.
        Use Class method as alternative constructors to provide multiple ways of creating our objects.
        use the class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
    6. static method doesn't operate on the instance or the class and doesn't pass any instance variable. 
        it used by calling @staticmethod decorator. This method canâ€™t access or modify the class state.
        Use static methods to create utility functions. 
    7. Inheritance allows us to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.
    8. dunder method is a built-in method that contains double underscore 
    9. @property decorators - getters, setters and deleters allows us to define a method and we can access
        it like an attribute with
